# Plug-ins (plugins): SDK, ABI v1

The app runs plug-ins as WebAssembly modules in a sandbox: `wasmi`, a pure-Rust interpreter (crate
`crates/plugins`, `lcc-plugins`). A plug-in can only do what the user grants it. Lightroom Lua
plug-ins are not supported.

## What a plug-in can add

| Contribution | Manifest | Request it receives |
|---|---|---|
| Menu commands, optionally with a dialog | `commands: [{id, label, menu, dialog, prepare?}]` | `{"hook":"command","command","args","selection","source"}`; with `prepare: true`, first `{"hook":"command.prepare","command","selection","source"}` (`source`: see [Adding files to the library](#adding-files-to-the-library); see [Settings, remembered values and prepare steps](#settings-remembered-values-and-prepare-steps)) |
| Settings (the plug-in's page in the Plug-in Manager) | `settings: [{key, label, type, …, prepare?}]` | none, or `{"hook":"settings.prepare"}` when a field has `prepare: true`; the plug-in reads them with `settings.get` |
| Export post-processing | `hooks.export: true` | `{"hook":"export","files":[{path, photo}]}`; the exported files are lent to the call for reading and writing |
| Metadata and keyword suggestions | `hooks.metadata: true` | `{"hook":"metadata","photos":[photo.inspect JSON]}` → `{"suggestions":[{photo, fields?, keywords?}]}` |
| A publish service (kind `plugin:<id>` in `publish.addService`) | `publish: {id, name}` | `{"hook":"publish.upload","service","item":{path, photo, title, caption, keywords, remoteId?}}` → `{remoteId, url?}`; `{"hook":"publish.delete","service","remoteId"}` |
| Export destinations ("Then send to" in the Export dialog) | `exportDestinations: [{id, name, dialog}]` | `{"hook":"export.destination","destination","args","files":[{path, photo}]}` after the files are written and the export hooks ran; the files are lent to the call; a `message` in the reply is shown |
| Programs it starts (an installed tool, such as a raw converter) | `permissions.programs: [{id, name, macBundleIds?, windowsExe?, linuxExe?}]` | `{"hook":"program.end","run","program","status","code","tmpDir"}` when a run ends (see [Programs](#programs)) |
| Custom metadata fields (Metadata panel ▸ Plug-in fields) | `metadataFields: [{key, label, type, …, readOnly?}]` | none: the values are the plug-in's namespace entries under each field's `key` (`ns.set {photo, key, value}`); the user edits them in the panel on every selected photo (`plugin.setField {ids}`; differing values read `< mixed >`), read-only ones only the plug-in sets. The plug-in's data stays the source; the app keeps an in-memory index of it (`Photo.plugin_fields`, never saved with the catalog, so its format is unchanged: rebuilt when a library opens and after every plug-in command and export hook): Library filter text search finds the values (`key:value` for one field), smart-album and filter rules test them as `plugin:<id>/<key>` (Rules ▸ Plug-in Fields; text operators, number fields compare as numbers: is ≥, is between, …), and XMP sidecars carry them as `lcpf:fields` (a bag of `{lcpf:plugin, lcpf:key, lcpf:value}`, namespace `<homepage>/ns/plugin-fields/1.0/`, from `homepage` in `brand.toml`) when metadata is saved, and give them back to the plug-in's data on import, Synchronize Folder and Read Metadata from File (installed, enabled plug-ins only; read-only fields included; values the field doesn't take are skipped) |

Commands appear under File ▸ Plug-ins and run as the engine command `plugin.run {plugin, command, args?, ids?, source?}`. The UI, CLI,
control channel and MCP all use this command. `plugin.commands` lists the commands so front
ends can build menus and dialogs. Dialog fields are `{key, label, type}`, where `type` is one of
`text` (`default`), `number` (`min`, `max`, `default`), `bool` (`default`) or `choice`
(`options`, `default`). The host checks the values against the fields and clamps numbers before
the plug-in sees them. A dialog opens with the values it last ran with (see below).

## Settings, remembered values and prepare steps

These need the host feature **`settings`**: a plug-in that uses any of them says
`"requires": ["settings"]` (see [Compatibility](#compatibility-requires-and-version)).

- **Settings** (`settings: [{key, label, type, …}]`, at most 32, the same field types as dialogs)
  are the plug-in's own options, kept for the whole app (not per library). The plug-in's page in
  the Plug-in Manager has a Settings tab with the fields, *Save* and *Revert*; a save that fails
  keeps the values typed and says why. The plug-in reads them with `settings.get` (every key; the default
  for one never set or no longer fitting its field) and may change one with
  `settings.set {key, value}` (checked against its field; `null` goes back to the default).
  Engine commands: `plugin.settings {id}` and `plugin.setSettings {id, values}`. Saving is
  all-or-nothing: an unknown key or a value that doesn't fit changes nothing.
- **Remembered dialog values.** A command's or an export destination's dialog opens with the
  values it last ran with (`values` in `plugin.commands` and `plugin.exportDestinations`). A field
  with `"remember": false` always opens with its default (a "delete instead" switch, say). The
  values are remembered whenever the command is run with arguments, from the UI or not, and stored
  with the settings.
- **Prepare steps.** A command with `"prepare": true` is asked first, with
  `{"hook":"command.prepare","command","selection"}`, how to run on this selection. It answers
  with exactly one of:
  - `{"dialog": {<key>: {options?, default?}}}`: open the dialog with these options and defaults
    (only the keys given change);
  - `{"run": {<key>: value}}`: run at once with these arguments, no dialog (checked like dialog
    values);
  - `{"message": "…"}`: nothing to do; the text (at most 4096 characters) is shown and nothing
    runs.

  A prepare step **can only read**, whatever the plug-in is granted: there, `metadata.setStandard`,
  `ns.set`, `settings.set`, `fs.writeText`, `fs.writeBytes`, `fs.remove`, `program.start` and any
  `http.request` other than `GET` or `HEAD` fail with "a prepare step can only read". The command
  itself may write as usual.

  A `choice` field with no `options` (`"options": []`) gets its options only from the prepare
  step; it is allowed only in a command with `prepare`. A settings field with `"prepare": true`
  is prepared the same way when the page opens: `{"hook":"settings.prepare"}` → `{"fields":
  {<key>: {options?, default?}}}`. A prepare step that fails (an error, a trap, a time-out, an
  answer that doesn't fit) is logged and the dialog opens as declared, with the reason shown; when
  a field's options can only come from it, the command doesn't run. At run time the command's
  arguments are checked against the prepared fields again. Engine command:
  `plugin.prepare {plugin, command, ids?}` → `{dialog: [field + value], error}` | `{run}` |
  `{message}`; it runs nothing. `plugin.run` asks the prepare step too: on a `message` answer it
  returns `{message, ran: false}` and runs nothing; on a `run` answer without `args` it runs with
  the plug-in's arguments; when the prepare step failed, it refuses to run without `args`;
  otherwise `args` are checked against the fields as prepared (as declared after a `run` answer).
  The UI asks the prepare step once to decide what to show, and `plugin.run` asks it again, so a
  prepare step should be cheap and give the same answer for the same selection.

## Permissions

A plug-in gets nothing it did not ask for in `permissions`, and nothing the user did not approve.
Installing shows every requested permission with a checkbox, unticked, and grants only the ones the
user ticks; an update shows what it newly asks for and keeps nothing beyond the previous grant
unless approved. Through the engine, `plugin.install` without `grant` grants nothing new, and
`plugin.install` and `plugin.grant` never add `programs` (below). The Plug-in Manager can revoke a permission at any
time, and the change applies from the next call. In every call, the plug-in's effective rights
are the granted permissions intersected with the requested ones.

| Permission | Allows |
|---|---|
| `catalog: true` | `catalog.query`, `photo.inspect`, `catalog.stats`, `keyword.list` (read-only) |
| `metadataWrite: true` | `metadata.setStandard {ids, title?, caption?, keywords?, addKeywords?, …}` |
| `libraryAdd: true` | `library.add {path, from, stack?, album?}`: adds a file a tool made from a photo to the library, from that photo's folder only (see [Adding files to the library](#adding-files-to-the-library)). Requires `libraryAdd`. |
| `network: ["api.example.com", "*.example.org"]` | `http.request` to those hosts only. Redirects are not followed: the plug-in has to request the new URL itself, and that request is checked again. A binary body goes as `bodyBase64` (with `contentType`) instead of `body`. |
| `fs: [{path: "/abs/dir", write?}]` | `fs.readText`, `fs.readBytes`, `fs.list`, `fs.exists` below each root, and `fs.writeText`, `fs.writeBytes`, `fs.remove` (files only) below writable roots. Bytes travel as base64 (`{path}` → base64 text; `{path, base64}`). `..` is rejected, and symbolic links are resolved so a link cannot lead out of a root. Files lent to a call (an export hook's or destination's exported files, a publish upload's rendered file) can be read and rewritten without any root, never removed. A program run's folder is lent to its `program.end` call for reading. |
| `programs: [{id, name, macBundleIds?, windowsExe?, linuxExe?}]` | `program.start` of those programs, with the arguments the plug-in chooses on each run (see [Programs](#programs)); `program.list` needs nothing. Only the user grants one, by ticking it in the install dialog or the Plug-in Manager. `plugin.install` with `grant` and `plugin.grant`, whoever calls them (MCP, the control channel, an action, the command line), may repeat the programs already granted (they stay granted) or leave them out (revoked), and refuse a grant that names any other program or a wider entry than the granted one, changing nothing. The control channel's input requests (`ui.pointer`, `ui.clickWidget`, `ui.key`) work the dialog as the user's mouse and keyboard would, so a row ticked through them counts as the user's: give the control port only to agents you would let tick it. |

Every plug-in can always use its own **metadata namespace** (`ns.get {photo}`,
`ns.set {photo, key, value}`, `ns.photos`). The namespace is stored next to the module, never in
the catalog. Photo ids are only unique within one library, so the namespace is kept per library:
a plug-in always sees the data of the library that is open (each library gets a stable
`libraryId` in its `catalog-settings.json` the first time; a library without a folder, e.g. one
held in memory, shares one unnamed namespace).

## Programs

A plug-in can hand photos to a program installed on the computer (a raw converter, a denoiser) and
pick up what it made when it ends. It requires the host feature `programs` (`"requires":
["programs"]`), and each program is an entry in `permissions.programs`:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `id` | the program's id in this plug-in (1–64 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -`) |
| `name` | shown to the user (install dialog, Plug-in Manager, activity stack) |
| `macBundleIds` | macOS: the app's bundle ids, newest version first (at most 8); each is a version the user may have installed |
| `windowsExe` | Windows: the executable's file name, looked up under `App Paths` in the registry (per user, per machine, then the machine's 32-bit view), then in the absolute folders on `PATH` |
| `linuxExe` | Linux and the BSDs: the executable's file name, looked up in the absolute folders on `PATH` |

An entry names at least one of the three, and at most 8 programs per plug-in. Executable names are
plain file names that are valid on every system (no folder, none of `<>:"/\|?*`, no device name
such as `CON` or `NUL.txt`, no trailing dot or space). On macOS the app finds each bundle id with
Spotlight and reads its version from the app's `Info.plist`; elsewhere the version is not read.
When Spotlight knows several copies, the one in `/Applications` or `~/Applications` is used, then
one elsewhere on the startup disk, then one on another volume (a mounted disk image, an external
drive); a copy in the Trash never is. A
lookup that takes more than 3 seconds is stopped and finds nothing. The install dialog and the
Plug-in Manager show each entry as a permission row with what it names on this system (the bundle
ids, or the executable) and where it is installed ("not installed" if nowhere, "checking…" while
the app looks; the dialog never waits for a lookup). An update that widens a granted entry shows it
unticked and marked new. An update keeps a granted entry when
it names no more than before: renaming it, reordering or removing bundle ids and dropping an
executable keep the grant. An update that adds a bundle id or changes an executable unticks the
entry, with a line in the plug-in's log, until the user ticks it again: the user allowed
particular programs, not whatever the entry names later. An install from a command
(`plugin.install`) whose module differs from the installed one keeps none of the plug-in's
programs, with a line in its log: the user allowed them for the code they had. Installing the same
module again keeps them.

**What a grant covers:** the user allows a program, not a particular use of it. The plug-in chooses
the arguments and the files it hands the program on every run (`program.start {args, files}`); the
host checks only their names and sizes, never what they ask the program to do. So a grant gives the
plug-in whatever that program can do with the arguments it accepts, and the install dialog and the
Plug-in Manager show which program it is, not how the plug-in will use it.

- **`program.list`** → `[{program, name, granted, installed: [{bundleId?, path?, version?}]}]` for
  every declared program, in manifest order (on macOS, installs in the entry's order). It needs no
  permission, so a plug-in can tell the user what to install or allow; `path`, where the program
  is installed, comes only once the program is granted.
- **`program.start {program, args?, files?, bundleId?}`** → `{run, tmpDir}`:
  1. it checks everything first: the program is declared and granted; `files` (`{name: text}`, at
     most 64 plain file names, 8 MiB in all) and `args` (at most 256 strings of 4 KiB) are valid;
     `bundleId` (macOS only) is one of the entry's;
  2. it makes a new folder for the run (private to the user) and writes `files` into it; every
     `{tmpDir}` in `args` becomes that folder's path;
  3. it starts the program with `args`, `TMPDIR` set to the folder (elsewhere `TEMP` and `TMP`
     too) and its standard input and output discarded: on macOS the first installed bundle id in the entry's order (or `bundleId`),
     as a new instance (`open -n -W -a`, with `--env` for `TMPDIR`); elsewhere the executable
     directly (on Windows with no console window).

  Nothing is written or started when a check fails, and a program that exits with an error at once
  is reported as not started. One run per program and plug-in at a time: a second start while a
  run is active is refused. A failed start adds a line to the plug-in's log (at most 20 per call).

  Only a plug-in command (`plugin.run`, a menu item) starts programs: export hooks, export
  destinations, metadata providers and `program.end` can list programs but get an error from
  `program.start` ("start the program from a command"), and so do a command's and the settings'
  prepare steps ("a prepare step can only read"). Publish services have neither (no
  catalog, no programs). A command's lookups (at most 3 seconds per lookup) and the check that the
  program didn't fail at once (300 ms) run on the thread that runs the command, in the app the UI
  thread, so a start can hold the window that long.
- **`program.end`**: when the program exits, the plug-in gets `{"hook":"program.end","run",
  "program","status","code","tmpDir"}` once, on a worker thread, with the run's folder lent for
  reading (`status`: `exited`, `cancelled` or `failed`; `code`: the program's exit code, or null on
  macOS, where `open` starts it, after a cancel, and for a program ended by a signal). Its catalog
  reads and writes are answered on the UI thread, as for export hooks; a session with no UI
  (headless MCP, the CLI) refuses them. `program.list` works there; `program.start` doesn't (start
  programs from a command, where the user is).
- **The activity stack** shows each run ("Waiting for a plug-in's program", kind `pluginProgram`;
  detail: the program's name). ✕ ends the run (`program.end` with `cancelled`) but leaves the
  program running: it belongs to the user now.
- **The run's folder** is deleted once `program.end` has returned and the program has exited, also
  when the hook fails. If the app quits first, the folder is left for the program; the next start
  of the app removes run folders more than a day old, except those of runs another copy of the app
  still watches (each run holds a lock file next to its folder).
- The web build has no programs: `program.start` returns an error there.

## Adding files to the library

A tool such as a raw converter or a noise reducer makes new files from the photos it is sent. A
plug-in with the **`libraryAdd`** permission adds them to the library, stacked on the photo each
came from or in the album the user sent them from. It requires the host feature `libraryAdd`
(`"requires": ["libraryAdd"]`, see [Compatibility](#compatibility-requires-and-version)), which
covers the permission, `library.add` and `source`.

- **`source`**: the `command` and `command.prepare` requests say where the command was started:
  the Library source shown in the left panel, whatever search or filter is on top of it.

  | `source` | Started from |
  |---|---|
  | `{kind: "album", id, name, quick?}` | a regular album: also the Quick Collection (`quick: true`) and saved creations |
  | `{kind: "smartAlbum", id, name}` | a smart album |
  | `{kind: "folder", path}` | a folder of the library, or a folder on disk being browsed |
  | `{kind: "allPhotos"}` | All Photographs |
  | `{kind: "other", name}` | another view: `picks`, `recentlyAdded`, `previousImport`, `previousExport`, `missing`, `recentlyDeleted`, and `albumFolder` (an album folder, which holds albums, not photos) |

  It is the session's source, as the selection is the session's selection, so the menu, the
  control channel and MCP all send it; `plugin.run` and `plugin.prepare` take a `source` of their
  own to replace it. A plug-in that hands photos to a tool keeps it (in the run's files, say) to
  use when the results come back, as the user may have moved on by then. In Rust:
  `req.source()`, and `req.source_album()` for the id of an album that can hold photos.
- **`library.add {path, from, stack?, album?}`** (`host::library_add(path, from, stack, album)`)
  → `{photo, added, reloaded}`:
  - `from` is the photo the file was made from: a photo of the library (not in Recently Deleted)
    with a file. `path` is an absolute path to a file in the folder of `from`'s original or below
    it, after symbolic links are resolved; that is where such tools write by default. It can't
    be `from`'s original itself. A path reached through a link is added under the folder's own
    path, so the same file is never in the library twice.
  - The file is imported in place, as a new photo with its own settings: `from`'s develop
    settings are not copied. A copy of a file the library has elsewhere is added too.
  - `stack: true` stacks it directly above `from`, in `from`'s stack or a new one, as Edit In
    does. Without it, `library.add` doesn't stack it (the import may still stack a file by its
    own rules, such as a DNG's link to the file it was derived from).
  - `album` (an id from `source`) adds it to that album, which must be a regular album that
    holds `from`, so a plug-in can only file a result next to its source. A photo that left the
    album while the tool ran gives an error: try again without `album`.
  - A file the library has already returns that photo with `added: false`; `stack` and `album`
    still apply, and nothing is listed twice. If the file changed since the library read it (a
    tool wrote over its earlier result), it is read again as *Reload from Disk* (`photo.reload`)
    does, with `reloaded: true`: new size, dimensions and content hash, cached previews dropped;
    the photo keeps its id, settings, stack and albums. A photo the user had deleted comes back
    from Recently Deleted (`added: true`), read again the same way when the file changed.
  - Everything is checked before the library changes; an error adds nothing (should a later step
    fail after all, what was done is undone). What does change is one undo step ("Add from
    Plug-in"), and the user's selection stays as it was.
  - It is a write: prepare steps can't call it. In `program.end`, the call is answered on the UI
    thread, like the hook's catalog reads.

The `program-tools` example (below) does the whole round trip.

## Limits

Each call runs in a fresh instance. It has an instruction budget, a wall-clock budget (time spent
in host requests counts), a memory cap of 256 MiB by default, a recursion cap, a 16 MiB cap on
each message, and at most 10 000 host calls. A module that breaks any of these, traps, or returns
bad JSON fails with an error and is logged; the app keeps running. A module can have no imports
other than the three below (no WASI).

## Compatibility: `requires` and `version`

The ABI version (below) only changes for a breaking change. Everything added to it since is
named, and a plug-in lists the names it uses in **`requires`**, so a version of the app that lacks
one refuses it clearly instead of failing in confusing ways (a permission that never appears, a
hook that's never called, a host call that fails as an unknown method).

- **The host's list** is `lcc_plugins::HOST_FEATURES`, and `plugin.list` returns it as
  `host: {abi, features}`. Everything the host had when `requires` arrived is the baseline and
  has no name. Names so far: `programs` ([Programs](#programs)), `settings` ([below](#settings-remembered-values-and-prepare-steps)), `libraryAdd` ([Adding files to the library](#adding-files-to-the-library)). Every manifest field, permission group or host call added
  from then on gets a name there in the change that adds it, and its documentation here says
  which name to require.
- **Names** are `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`, at most 64, none repeated; anything else is a manifest
  error. A name is a minimum, never a maximum.
- **Installing** a plug-in that requires a name the host doesn't know is refused, naming each
  missing feature ("needs `jobs`, which this version of the app doesn't have"), and nothing is
  written. `plugin.inspectFile` lists them as `missing`, and the install dialog shows them with
  no Install button.
- **An installed plug-in** that requires a name the host no longer knows (the app was
  downgraded) doesn't load: `plugin.list` lists it under `failed` with `missing`. Its entry in
  `plugins.json` (enabled state and grant) and its data are kept, so it loads as before once the
  app is updated again.
- **Removing** a plug-in that didn't load (it needs missing features, or its module can't be read)
  works like any other: each `failed` row gives its `id`, `plugin.uninstall {id}` deletes its
  module, its `plugins.json` entry and its data, and the Plug-in Manager lists it with a
  didn't-load mark (under Pixel Filters for a filter module) and a page that says why, with a
  Remove button.
- Versions of the app from before `requires` ignore it, like any field they don't know: the check
  protects from this version on.

**`version`** is required and is semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, optionally with a pre-release
(`2.0.0-beta.1`) and build metadata (`+build.7`). Installing refuses a missing or invalid one
(`plugin.inspectFile` gives the reason as `versionError`). A module installed before this rule
without a valid version still loads, and its log says so.

**Downgrades** need confirming. Versions compare by semver precedence: a pre-release comes before
its release, and build metadata is ignored. Installing a lower version than the installed one is
refused unless `plugin.install` gets `allowDowngrade: true`; `plugin.inspectFile` says
`downgrade: true`, and the install dialog shows both versions and an *Install Older Version*
button. The older version keeps the grant, cut back to what it asks for, and its log says
"downgraded from X to Y". The same version again is a repair and installs without asking.

Pixel filters (below) have their own manifest, shared with PhotoCraft, and none of this applies to
them.

## The ABI

All messages are UTF-8 JSON. An `i64` result packs `len << 32 | ptr`, pointing into the module's
memory.

Exports: `memory`, `lcc_abi_version() -> i32` (returns 1), `lcc_manifest() -> i64`,
`lcc_alloc(len: i32) -> i32`, `lcc_handle(ptr: i32, len: i32) -> i64`. `lcc_handle` replies
`{"ok": value}` or `{"error": "message"}`.

Imports (module `host`):

- `call(ptr, len) -> i32`: sends `{"method", "params"}` and returns the length of the reply,
  which is `{"ok": value}` or `{"error": "message"}`;
- `response(ptr)`: copies that reply into a buffer of that length;
- `log(ptr, len)`: adds one line to the plug-in's log, shown in the Plug-in Manager.

## Writing one in Rust

The guest SDK is `sdk/plugin` (`lcc-plugin-sdk`). Six examples, each a complete plug-in:

| Example | Shows |
|---|---|
| `sdk/examples/catalog-tools` | every hook in one place: a menu command with a dialog, the plug-in's own namespace, a metadata provider, an export hook and a publish service |
| `sdk/examples/batch-metadata` | a small useful tool (`catalog` + `metadataWrite`): *Title / Caption from Template…* fills the title or caption of the selected photos from a template with tokens (`{name}`, `{file}`, `{date}`, `{year}`, `{camera}`, `{n}` with a start number); *Add Keywords…* adds comma-separated keywords. Every write goes through `metadata.setStandard` |
| `sdk/examples/export-tools` | **export hooks**: a post-process hook that reads each exported file (binary, `host::read_bytes`) and records its CRC-32; an **export destination** "WebDAV Upload" that `PUT`s the files to a server (`host::http_bytes`, basic auth, a dry-run switch) |
| `sdk/examples/publish-folder` | a **publish service** "Local Gallery": copies each rendered photo into a gallery folder (one writable `fs` root), keeps an `index.json`, replaces on re-publish and deletes on removal |
| `sdk/examples/program-tools` | **programs and adding files** (`requires: ["programs", "libraryAdd"]`): *Send to Converter* writes the selected photos' ids and originals, and the album it was started from, into the run's folder and starts a granted program on that list (`host::program_start`); its **`program.end`** hook reads the program's `result.txt` and adds each result to the library, stacked on its photo and in that album (`host::library_add`), or logs the exit code when the program failed |
| `sdk/examples/keyword-picker` | **settings, remembered values and a prepare step** (`requires: ["settings"]`): *Apply Keyword…* adds (or, with a switch that is never remembered, removes) one keyword on the selected photos, picked from the keywords in use. Its prepare step offers the keywords used on at least *n* photos (a setting), most used first or A to Z (another), runs at once when only one qualifies and explains when none does |
| `sdk/examples/custom-fields` | **custom metadata fields** Client / Job / Usage (editable in the Metadata panel) and Delivered (read-only), a *Set Job Fields…* command for the selection, an export hook that marks exported photos delivered, and a metadata provider that suggests the client as a keyword |

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cd sdk/examples/catalog-tools
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
# install target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/catalog_tools.wasm:
#   File ▸ Plug-ins ▸ Plug-in Manager…, or  <cli> commands plugin.install '{"path": "…"}'
```

`lcc-plugins`' test suite (`crates/plugins/tests/example.rs`) builds every example to wasm32 and
runs each hook and command of them. Without the wasm32 target installed, those tests are skipped.

## Guide for plug-in authors

### 1. Start a crate

A plug-in is a `cdylib` of its own (outside the app's workspace) that depends on the SDK:

```toml
[package]
name = "hello"
edition = "2024"

[workspace]

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]   # rlib: unit tests of your logic run natively

[dependencies]
lcc-plugin-sdk = { path = "…/sdk/plugin" }   # or a git dependency on this repository

[profile.release]
opt-level = "s"
panic = "abort"
lto = true
strip = true
```

### 2. Declare a manifest and handle requests

```rust
use lcc_plugin_sdk::{export_plugin, host, Request};
use lcc_plugin_sdk::serde_json::{json, Value};

const MANIFEST: &str = r#"{"id": "org.example.hello", "name": "Hello", "version": "1.0.0",
  "permissions": {"catalog": true}, "commands": [{"id": "count", "label": "Count Photos"}]}"#;

fn handle(req: &Request) -> Result<Value, String> {
    match req.hook() {
        "command" => {
            let stats = host::call("catalog.stats", json!({}))?;
            Ok(json!({"message": format!("{} photos", stats["photos"])}))
        }
        other => Err(format!("unsupported hook {other}")),
    }
}
export_plugin!(MANIFEST, handle);
```

`export_plugin!` exports the ABI; `handle` gets every request. Reply with `Ok(value)` or
`Err(message)`: an error is shown to the user and written to the plug-in's log. A `message` in a
command's or destination's reply is shown as a notice.

The manifest fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable, `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`, reverse-DNS style; an install with the same id is an update |
| `version` | required, semver `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (see [Compatibility](#compatibility-requires-and-version)) |
| `requires` | `[names]`: the host features the plug-in uses beyond the baseline (see [Compatibility](#compatibility-requires-and-version)) |
| `name`, `description`, `author` | shown in the Plug-in Manager |
| `permissions` | what the plug-in asks for (see [Permissions](#permissions)); ask for as little as possible |
| `commands` | `[{id, label, menu?, dialog?, prepare?}]`, File ▸ Plug-ins ▸ `name` ▸ `menu` ▸ `label`; dialog fields may say `remember: false` |
| `settings` | `[{key, label, type, …, prepare?}]`, at most 32; needs `requires: ["settings"]` |
| `hooks` | `{export?: true, metadata?: true}` |
| `publish` | `{id, name}`: one publish service |
| `exportDestinations` | `[{id, name, dialog?}]`, at most 16 |
| `metadataFields` | `[{key, label, type, …, readOnly?}]`, at most 32; `type` and its options as for dialog fields |

### 3. Requests by hook

| `req.hook()` | Fields (`req.get(…)`, helpers) | Reply |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | `req.command()`, `req.arg(key)`, `req.selection()` (photo ids as strings), `req.source()` | anything; `message` is shown |
| `command.prepare` | `req.command()`, `req.selection()`, `req.source()` | exactly one of `{dialog: {<key>: {options?, default?}}}`, `{run: args}`, `{message}`; host calls may only read |
| `settings.prepare` | | `{fields: {<key>: {options?, default?}}}`, for fields with `prepare: true`; host calls may only read |
| `export` | `req.files()` → `(path, photo)` of the written files | anything |
| `export.destination` | `req.destination()`, `req.arg(key)`, `req.files()` | anything; `message` is shown |
| `metadata` | `photos`: `photo.inspect` JSON | `{suggestions: [{photo, fields?, keywords?}]}` |
| `publish.upload` | `item: {path, photo, title, caption, keywords, remoteId?}` | `{remoteId, url?}`; the same `remoteId` comes back on a re-publish and on removal |
| `publish.delete` | `remoteId` | anything |
| `program.end` | `req.run()`, `req.program()`, `req.status()` (`exited`, `cancelled`, `failed`), `req.code()` (the exit code, when known), `req.tmp_dir()` (readable during the call) | anything; failures go to the log |

### 4. Call the host

| SDK | Host method | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `host::call(method, params)` | any of the below | |
| `host::query(params)` | `catalog.query` (also `photo.inspect`, `catalog.stats`, `keyword.list` via `call`) | `catalog` |
| `host::call("metadata.setStandard", {ids, title?, caption?, keywords?, addKeywords?, …})` | writes standard fields | `metadataWrite` |
| `host::library_add(path, from, stack, album)` | `library.add {path, from, stack?, album?}` → `{photo, added, reloaded}` | `libraryAdd` |
| `host::ns_get(photo)`, `host::ns_set(photo, key, value)` | `ns.get`, `ns.set`, `ns.photos` | nothing (own namespace; also holds `metadataFields` values) |
| `host::read_text`, `host::write_text`, `host::read_bytes`, `host::write_bytes`, `host::remove`, `host::exists` | `fs.*` | an `fs` root (or a lent file) |
| `host::http(method, url, headers, body)`, `host::http_bytes(…)` | `http.request` → `{status, contentType, location, body}` | the URL's host in `network` |
| `host::program_list()` | `program.list` | nothing |
| `host::program_start(program, args, files, bundle_id)` | `program.start` → `{run, tmpDir}` | the program in `programs` (granted by the user) |
| `host::settings()`, `host::setting(key)`, `host::set_setting(key, value)` | `settings.get`, `settings.set {key, value}` | nothing (own settings) |
| `host::log(line)` | `host.log` | nothing; Plug-in Manager ▸ Log |
| `lcc_plugin_sdk::base64::{encode, decode}` | | |

### 5. Rules the host enforces

- Every call runs in a **fresh instance**: keep state in the namespace, not in statics.
- **Budgets per call**: instructions (fuel), wall-clock time (network time counts), 256 MiB of
  memory, call depth, 16 MiB per message, 10 000 host calls, 8 MiB per file or HTTP body. Batch
  work in chunks the user can re-run rather than one huge call.
- Everything a plug-in returns is **checked**: dialog values are coerced to their fields before
  the plug-in sees them, `metadataFields` values that no longer fit the field show as empty, and a
  reply that is not JSON, too large or late is an error. Nothing a plug-in does can crash the app.
- **Permissions are the user's**: each requested capability is a separate checkbox on install,
  unticked; an update that asks for more gets nothing new until approved; the user can revoke any
  permission later. Handle `permission … not granted` errors with a clear message.
- Paths must be **absolute** without `..`; links can't lead out of a root.
- **Programs** start only once the user has ticked them, one run per program at a time, and their
  folder lives only until the run is over: copy what you need out of it in `program.end`.

### 6. Test and ship

- Unit-test your logic natively (`cargo test`; the host calls answer "no host" off wasm).
- Build `--release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, then install from File ▸ Plug-ins ▸ Plug-in Manager…
  (*Install…* shows every permission for approval) or `<cli> commands plugin.install`.
- Drive it without the UI: `plugin.run`, `plugin.exportTo`, `plugin.setField`, `plugin.log` from
  the CLI, the control channel or MCP.
- Raise `version` with every release you hand out, and list in `requires` each host feature you
  use beyond the baseline.
- Distribute the `.wasm` file. There is no store and no signing yet: tell users what each
  permission is for.

## Engine commands

`plugin.list`, `plugin.inspectFile {path}`, `plugin.install {path, grant?, allowDowngrade?}`,
`plugin.uninstall {id}`, `plugin.enable {id, enabled}`, `plugin.grant {id, grant}`,
`plugin.log {id}`, `plugin.commands`, `plugin.prepare {plugin, command, ids?, source?}`,
`plugin.run {plugin, command, args?, ids?, source?}`, `plugin.settings {id}`, `plugin.setSettings {id, values}`,
`plugin.suggestMetadata {ids?}`, `plugin.postExport {files}`, `plugin.publishServices`,
`plugin.exportDestinations`, `plugin.exportTo {plugin, destination, files, args?}`,
`plugin.metadataFields {id?}`, `plugin.setField {plugin, field, value, id?}`.

`plugin.list` gives `{dir, host, plugins, failed}`: `dir` is the plug-ins folder (`null`
when plug-ins are kept in memory), each plug-in has its module's `moduleHash` (sha256) and a
`settingsRevision` that changes when one of its settings does, and each `failed` row has `file`, `error`, `kind` (`plugin` or
`filter`) and, when the module named one, `id`. A pixel filter module the filter loader refuses
gives the loader's error, not the plug-in host's. `plugin.enable` refuses a pixel filter: filters can't be turned off,
only removed.

### The Plug-in Manager (Plugin Manager)

File ▸ Plug-ins ▸ Plug-in Manager… (Cmd+Alt+Shift+, on macOS, Ctrl+Alt+Shift+, elsewhere; it can
be rebound in Keyboard Shortcuts) lists the plug-ins on the left, in two sections, Plug-ins and
Pixel Filters, each with an icon drawn from its id (the same id always gets the same icon), its
name, version and a mark: enabled, disabled or didn't load. The selected entry's page is on the
right:

- **A plug-in:** Enabled, Remove, and tabs: Settings (when it declares settings), Permissions (each
  one it asks for, granted or revoked by its box), About (description, what it adds, its commands
  to run, the module's size) and Log.
- **A pixel filter:** Remove, its stage, whether it measures the photo (the cropped photo or the
  whole one), its base tone, parameters, and the module's size and hash. Filters have no Enabled
  box.
- **A module that didn't load:** why, and Remove.

*Install from File…* opens the file picker for a `.wasm` module, and dropping one `.wasm` file on
the app while the window is open installs it too; either way the install dialog asks for the
permissions first. One install at a time: while the dialog waits, another module is refused with a
note to finish or cancel the first. A module that is exactly what is installed (the same id,
version and code) opens no dialog: its entry is selected, with a note that it is already
installed. Other code under the installed version (a repair) and a newer version open the dialog.
An open Settings tab follows its plug-in: after an update, or a value the plug-in or an agent set,
it shows the current fields and values, keeping what the user typed and hasn't saved. The window
can be dragged narrower or wider; a page's text wraps to it. The footer names the plug-ins folder,
with *Show Folder* to open it.

The window's own commands, for the control channel and `<cli> mcp --connect` (they exist only
while the app runs): `plugins.manager {open?}` (toggles the window), `plugins.install {path?}` (the
install dialog for `path`, or the file picker without one: `{pending: path}`, or `{installed: id,
message}` when that module is already installed; an error while another install waits), `plugins.page {id, tab?, open?}` (the
window with that entry selected, on `tab`: `settings`, `permissions`, `about` or `log`; it fails
for a tab the entry doesn't have), `plugins.showFolder` (the folder in the system file manager) and
`plugins.runItem {plugin, command}`.

`app.export` runs the enabled export hooks after every export (the Export dialog, Export with
Preset / Previous, the CLI, the control channel and MCP) and, with
`pluginDestination: {plugin, destination, args?}`, hands the written files to that destination;
the results come back as `plugins: [{plugin, destination?, ok | error}]`.

In the app, a background export (the Export dialog, Export with Preset / Previous) runs them on a
worker thread once the files are written, with a row in the activity stack ("Running plug-in
export hooks", kind `plugins`; detail: the plug-in in progress), so a long upload doesn't hold
the window. ✕ stops before the next plug-in: a call that has started (a plug-in's code) runs to
its end or its time limit. A plug-in's catalog reads and metadata writes are answered on the UI
thread, with the same permission checks. The Plug-in Manager stays usable meanwhile; a plug-in that
is still busy with the export refuses other calls until it's done ("busy"). The results go to the
toast and to `ui.inspect` → `export.last.plugins` when they finish. An export run synchronously
(`app.export` without `background`, the CLI, MCP) runs them before it returns, as before.

Plug-ins are installed per user in `<settings_dir>/plugins`, or in `<PREFIX>_PLUGINS` if that
is set. That folder holds `<id>.wasm`, `plugins.json` (enabled state and grants) and
`data/<id>.json` (the plug-in's namespace: `{"format": 2, "libraries": {<library id>: {<photo id>:
{…}}}}`; a file written before namespaces were kept per library is claimed whole by the first
library opened from a folder, so no value is lost), and `settings/<id>.json` (its settings and
remembered dialog values: `{"format": 1, "settings": {…}, "dialogs": {"command/<id>" |
"destination/<id>": {…}}}`; a damaged file reads as empty, says so in the plug-in's log, and is
kept as `<id>.json.bad` when the next save replaces it; an update drops the keys the new version no
longer declares, and removing the plug-in deletes the file). A module copied into the folder by hand loads
disabled and with no permissions granted.

## Pixel filters (PhotoCraft ABI)

Besides the plug-ins above, <app> runs **pixel filters** written for PhotoCraft's plug-in ABI v1
(the `lcc-filters` crate, `crates/filters/README.md`): a module with no imports exporting
`memory`, `pc_abi_version`, `pc_manifest`, `pc_alloc` and `pc_filter`. They install the same way
(File ▸ Plug-ins ▸ Plug-in Manager…, or `<cli> commands plugin.install '{"path": "film.wasm"}'`): the host
sniffs the exports and keeps filter modules in the same folder, in a registry of their own.
`plugin.list` shows each as `{id, name, version, kind: "filter", params, moduleHash, size, analyze}`
(`params` is the manifest's spec); `plugin.uninstall` removes one. Filters ask for no permissions.

A photo's filter stack is part of its develop settings (`develop.pluginFilter.add {plugin,
stage?, params?}` — `params` are checked against the installed manifest and defaults filled in —
`.set`, `.move`, `.remove`, `.list`); every change is one History step, and the stack is copied,
synced and written to XMP with the other settings. Two stages:

| stage | runs | samples handed over |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | after geometry (crop, lens, perspective), before white balance, tone and every other step | linear light, sRGB primaries, `"encoding": "linear"` |
| `display` (default) | after the develop adjustments, before quantisation | sRGB-curve encoded in the output's primaries, `"encoding": "srgb"`; linear for HDR renders |

Each filter gets its resolved parameters plus `encoding`, `_analysis` (below) and `_image` (the
band's place in the whole output frame, so a zoomed view and an export line up). Source results
are cached: dragging other sliders doesn't re-run the filter; a draft while a filter's own
parameter changes runs it on a reduced copy (at most 0.5 MP), the full render after it is exact.
Renders with plug-in filters use the CPU pipeline. A filter that isn't installed or fails is
skipped: the render goes on and reports a warning (logged as `render: …`).

**Whole-image measurement (ABI v1.1 proposal).** A module may export
`pc_analyze(buf, len, w, h, channels, format, params, params_len) -> i64` returning
`len << 32 | ptr` of a JSON object (0 = nothing). `develop.pluginFilter.analyze {uid}` runs it
once on the whole uncropped photo (long edge 1024, linear sRGB primaries) and stores the result
with the photo (`setAnalysis`). It runs in the background as an activity row (kind
`pluginAnalyze`, cancellable) and returns at once; `wait: true` runs it to the end and returns the
result. Every later `pc_filter` call gets it as `_analysis`, so crop and
zoom don't move the measurement. Modules without the export give an "unsupported" error.
A manifest may set `"analyzeArea": "crop"` (default `"frame"`; other values mean the frame) to be
measured on the photo as its develop geometry frames it instead: orientation, crop, straighten,
flips, lens profile and perspective, what the Source stage sees (a negative converter measuring
inside the user's crop, say). The measurement still doesn't move with later crops; measuring again
picks up a new one. Hosts without the field measure the frame. `plugin.list` shows it as
`analyzeArea`.

**Menu groups (ABI v1.1 proposal).** A choice parameter may carry `"groups"`, one name per option
(`""` = not in a group): `{"type": "choice", "options": ["Generic", "Portra 400", "Superia 400"],
"groups": ["", "Kodak", "Fujifilm"]}`. Develop ▸ Plug-in Filters shows each group as a collapsible
section of the dropdown, in order of first appearance, the one holding the current choice open;
options without a group stay at the top level, in place. A list of another length, or with a name
that isn't 1-64 printable characters, is ignored (a flat menu), as hosts without the field do.
`plugin.list` gives each grouped parameter's `groups`. The dropdown is widget
`pluginFilterChoice:<uid>:<param>`.
**Base tone (ABI v1.1 proposal).** A raw is toned after the Source stage: by its camera's own
curve when the file has one, else by the default raw curve. A Source filter whose output is
already a finished picture (a negative conversion with its own tone curve) may set
`"baseTone": "neutral"` (default `"camera"`; other values mean the camera's): the photo is then
shown as it is, as a JPEG would be, so the filter's tones aren't toned a second time. Contrast,
Whites and Blacks still apply. Hosts without the field use their base tone. `plugin.list` shows it as
`baseTone`.

**Pixel scale.** A Source filter that reads neighbours (manifest `overlap` > 0: an unsharp mask,
grain, a blur) would look different at each render size, its kernel spanning more of the photo in
a small preview than in a full-size export. Such a stack runs once on the whole frame at the
source's own resolution (capped at 100 MP, 24 MP on the web) and every render (preview, loupe,
zoomed window, export at any size) is resampled from that result, so they agree. The result is
kept per photo, frame and stack: other sliders, zooming and a later export reuse it; a draft that
finds none shows the reduced-copy proxy until the full render replaces it. Per-pixel filters
(`overlap` 0) run on the render's own pixels.

Auto (tone), Auto B&W Mix, Upright (and Auto straighten), the auto masks (with or without a
model), automatic spot sources and a zoomed view's dehaze estimate read the photo as the Source
filters turn it (long edge 2048, cached per photo and stack; a change of the stack re-runs them).

## Not done yet

- A plug-in call that has started can't be interrupted (✕ takes effect between plug-ins), and one
  export's hooks run at a time: hooks for an export that ends while the previous ones still run
  are skipped with a message.
- Network and filesystem permissions are fixed in the manifest: a WebDAV destination for "any
  server the user types" isn't possible; the author names the hosts.
- No plug-in store, signing or automatic updates; Lightroom Lua plug-ins don't run.
- Programs: a plug-in can't read a program's output while it runs, or stop it; ✕ only stops
  waiting. It adds what a program made only from the folder of the source photo, and can't make
  an album for the results. Versions are read on macOS only.
- Pixel filters: a Display filter with `overlap` > 0 still works in output pixels (it runs after
  every develop step, so a native-resolution pass would mean a full-size develop per preview), so
  a preview and a larger export of one differ.
