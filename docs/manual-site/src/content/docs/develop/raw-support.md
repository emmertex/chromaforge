- **Reference**: 1,446 camera models listed by Adobe; about 596 decode and are checked on a real file, about 724 should decode but are not checked (mostly DNG phones), 89 show the embedded preview only, 37 are unsupported. An estimated 98% of photographers' cameras decode.
- **Image formats**: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, JXL, PSD, GIF, BMP, DNG (including lossy and JPEG XL).
- **Raw decoders**, in pure Rust: Sony ARW (including cRAW, lossless and Compressed RAW 2 from the A7R VI), Canon CR2, CR3 (CRX lossless and C-RAW; other variants fall back to the preview) and CRW, Nikon NEF (including High Efficiency for the Z50 II), Fujifilm RAF (uncompressed, lossless and lossy), Panasonic and Leica RW2, Olympus ORF, Pentax PEF and DNG, Samsung SRW, Epson ERF, Mamiya MEF, Apple ProRAW and other DNG.
- **Preview only**: Hasselblad 3FR and FFF, Phase One IIQ, MOS.
- **Not imported**: Sony SRF, some Kodak and Sigma X3F files.
- **Colour**: bundled camera profiles, per-file fits and measured matrices; Adobe's camera profiles are not used. This is the biggest open gap: see [Colour, grading and profiles](../colour/).
- Details per format are in the repository's `docs/raw-parity.md`, `docs/cr3.md`, `docs/nikon-he.md`, `docs/raf-compression.md` and `docs/arw6-compression.md`.
