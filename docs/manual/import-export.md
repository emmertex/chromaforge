## Import

File → Import Photos… (`Cmd+Shift+I`) or Import from Folder… (`library.import`):

- **Add** references the files where they are; **Copy** copies them into the library's `Originals/` (or a destination
  you pick); **Move** copies, verifies the copy byte for byte, then removes the source and its sidecars. Failed,
  duplicate and unverified files keep their sources.
- **Organise** copies by date (`YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD`), month, flat, or a folder template such as `{date:%Y}/{date:%Y%m%d}`.
- **Rename** with tokens (`{name}`, `{seq:4}`, `{date:%Y%m%d}`, `{camera}`, `{lens}` …; `photo.renameTokens` explains
  each), optionally convert raws to DNG while copying.
- Apply a develop preset, a metadata preset, keywords, and add the photos to a collection.
- Duplicates are detected and reported; a file in Recently Deleted can be skipped, restored with its edits, or
  imported fresh. Library → Find Duplicates… later finds copies already in the library ([duplicates.md](../duplicates.md)).
- Auto Import (Settings → Import) can watch subfolders, rename copies and apply a develop preset, metadata preset and
  keywords to arriving photos (`library.autoImport`). On Android the camera roll is a watched source (Settings → Folders,
  Watch for new photos).
- **Browse** (the Import tab, Settings → Import → Import as a tab): the bar's **Import** button imports the picks, the
  selection or all; **Develop** opens the selected photo without importing it. Develop, Print, Export and Slideshow
  chosen while browsing (module picker, shortcuts, File → Export…) work on the browsed selection the same way — export
  writes it with its current edits, print takes it as the only photo — and stay there until you go back to Library;
  a selected file the library already has opens as its library photo. Map, Book and Web switch to the library.
- File → Email Photo… exports the selection as small JPEGs and attaches them to a new message in the system mail program.

Other sources: File → Import Lightroom Catalog… ([migration guide](migrating-from-lightroom.md)), File → Import
from Immich… ([immich.md](../immich.md)), File → More Imports → Import from Another Catalog… ([catalogs.md](catalogs.md)), and
tethered capture ([tethering.md](tethering.md)). File → Import Profiles & Presets… reads presets (including
Lightroom `.xmp` presets); Import Keywords… reads keyword lists.

Supported files: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, AVIF/HEIF (also on Android), PSD, DNG and the common raw formats (Sony ARW, Nikon NEF, Canon
CR2/CR3, Fujifilm RAF, Panasonic RW2, Olympus ORF, Pentax PEF, Samsung SRW and more). Per-model status is in the
[parity tracker](../parity-checklist.md) (`LR-IMP-CAMERA-COVERAGE`).

## Export

File → Export… opens the export dialog; File → Export with Previous (`Cmd+Alt+Shift+E`) repeats the last one.

- Formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF (8/16/32-bit, LZW/ZIP), WebP, AVIF, DNG, or the original file with an XMP sidecar.
  HDR edits can export as gain-map JPEGs or float TIFFs.
- Size by long/short edge, width/height, megapixels or percent; resolution in ppi; JPEG quality or a file size limit.
- Colour space sRGB, Display P3, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB or Rec. 2020.
- Output sharpening (screen, matte, glossy), metadata (all, all except camera info, copyright only, none), location
  removal, file naming and subfolders, what to do with existing files.
- Watermarks: text (also vertical, for CJK) or a graphic, with size, opacity, anchor and inset.
- Save the settings as an export preset (`export.savePreset`); plug-ins can post-process exported files.
- File → Contact Sheet PDF… writes a quick contact sheet; the Print module does full layouts.

Export never overwrites an original or its sidecar (`export.checkTarget`). A subfolder or destination that escapes with `..`, or uses a Windows-reserved name, is refused. The Export preview of one photo shows the loupe's own render, and entering Export or Print from Develop selects the photo on screen. Print takes the single selected photo; only an empty selection prints the whole filmstrip.

## From the command line

The same encoder as the dialog:

```sh
<cli> render IMG_0001.CR3 -o out.jpg --set light.exposure=0.3 --preset <id> --size 2048 --quality 90
<cli> render in.ARW -o out.tif --opt colorSpace=proPhoto --opt bitDepth=16
<cli> run --library ~/Pictures/Lib library.import paths='["/media/card/DCIM"]' mode=copy \
    app.export dir=/tmp/out preset="<export preset name>"
```
