## What it is

Chromaforge is one catalog and seven modules (Library, Develop, Map, Book, Slideshow, Print, Web) in the Lightroom
Classic layout, with its own raw decoders, a scene-referred GPU/CPU develop pipeline and a command registry that the
UI, the CLI, a control channel and an MCP server all share.

- **Native** on macOS, Windows and Linux, **in the browser** via WebAssembly, and early on Android.
- **Local-first:** no account, no cloud, no telemetry, no subscription. The network is used only for things you turn on.
- **Non-destructive:** originals are never touched; edits live in the catalog and, if you like, in XMP sidecars.
- **Drivable end to end by AI agents** over MCP, with undo for everything they do.
- **Open source** (MIT). Chromaforge is a fork of an open-source project; its copyright notices are kept in [NOTICE](NOTICE)
  and [LICENSE](LICENSE).

# Features

## Seven modules, one catalog

Library and Develop are where you spend your day; Map, Book, Slideshow, Print and Web turn the same photos into
places, books, shows, prints and websites without exporting first. Pick a module at the top right, from
`Window → Modules`, or with ⌘⌥1–7.

## Editing

Every slider renders through a **scene-referred, wide-gamut, 32-bit float pipeline**: highlights roll off like film,
shadows open up without halos, and colour stays clean from capture to export.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Light** | Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, with edge-aware local tone mapping (a guided filter on log-luminance): −100 Highlights recovers a blown sky without grey halos. |
| **Color** | White balance by temperature and tint (Kelvin for raw, relative for JPEG) with presets, Auto and a click-to-neutralise eyedropper; Vibrance that protects skin tones, Saturation, an 8-band Color Mixer and 3-way Color Grading, all computed in OkLCh. |
| **Effects** | Texture, Clarity, Dehaze (dark-channel prior with guided refinement; negative adds atmosphere), post-crop Vignette with highlight priority, and resolution-independent film Grain. |
| **Tone Curve** | Parametric region curve with movable splits plus point curves for RGB, Red, Green and Blue; monotone by construction, so no accidental tone inversions. |
| **Crop & geometry** | Free or locked aspect ratios, drag-to-rotate straightening that keeps the largest crop inside the image, thirds / grid / golden-ratio overlays, flips, 90° rotations, manual transforms and Upright. |
| **Black & White** | One key (<kbd>V</kbd>) to monochrome, an 8-band B&W Mix, then tone it with Color Grading for selenium, sepia or split-tone prints. |
| **Presets & profiles** | Eighteen hand-built presets (*Golden Hour, Teal & Orange, Faded Matte, Selenium Tone, Crisp Landscape* and more), each with an Amount slider from 0 to 200 %; save your own, mark favourites, and copy, paste or sync exactly the groups you choose. |

</tr>
</table>

### Histogram & scopes

The histogram stays pinned at the top of the Edit panel while the controls scroll under it; drag across it to move
Blacks, Shadows, Exposure, Highlights or Whites. Beside the RGB, Luminance, R/G/B and Chroma histograms it has a
grading suite's scopes: **Waveform**, **RGB Parade** and **Vectorscope** with skin-tone line, on linear or
logarithmic scales.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/classic/scopes.jpg" alt="The Edit panel's histogram in four modes: RGB histogram, RGB Parade, Waveform with red, green and blue overlaid, and Vectorscope with graticule and colour targets" width="70%">
</p>

## Masking

Paint with a **Brush** (size, feather, flow, density, erase), drop **Linear** and **Radial Gradients** with draggable
pins, or select by **Luminance Range**, **Color Range**, **Sky**, **Subject**, **Background** and **Object**.
Combine components with **Add / Subtract / Intersect**, invert any of them, and dial in 15 local adjustments per mask
(Temp, Tint, Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Texture, Clarity, Dehaze, Hue, Saturation,
Sharpness, Noise) plus an overall Amount.

  <sub>A radial "Sun glow" mask (Temp +40, Exposure +0.50) layered over a linear "Sky" mask.</sub>
</p>

## Library and culling

The **Catalog** (All Photos, Quick Collection, Previous Import, Recently Added, Picks, Recently Deleted), **By
Date**, **Folders** and **Collections** in sets, with smart collections. The filter bar takes several keywords,
cameras or lenses at once. Rate with <kbd>0</kbd>–<kbd>5</kbd>, flag with <kbd>P</kbd> / <kbd>X</kbd> /
<kbd>U</kbd>, colour-label with <kbd>6</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd>. Search understands fields:
`rating:>3 flag:pick iso:>800 camera:x2 date:2026-04 keyword:mountains`. Every view sorts by capture, import or edit
date, name, rating, size or at random; albums also have a **Custom Order** (drag photos in the grid or filmstrip) that
slideshows, books, prints, exports and Rename `{seq}` follow. The grids are virtualized, so they stay smooth with forty
photos or forty thousand.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/classic/survey.jpg" alt="Library module in Survey view: four demo photos side by side with their ratings, Quick Develop and Keywording on the right"><br><sub><b>Survey</b> (<kbd>N</kbd>): narrow a selection down side by side.</sub></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/classic/compare.jpg" alt="Library module in Compare view: a Select photo of dunes beside a Candidate sunset photo"><br><sub><b>Compare</b> (<kbd>C</kbd>): Select against Candidate, with synced zoom.</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Video

Clips live in the same library as your photos. MP4, MOV, MKV, WebM, MPEG-TS and MXF with H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1,
ProRes, DNxHR, APV or MPEG-2 decode in pure Rust. Play a clip in the loupe (<kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>←</kbd> /
<kbd>→</kbd> for single frames), drag the trim handles, pick the poster frame the grid shows, and capture any frame as
a photo. The Light and Color controls (and presets that use only them) grade every frame. Export writes H.264 MP4 or
ProRes MOV with the trim, the grade and the sound (graded on the GPU for H.264); `<cli> render clip.mov -o out.mp4 --trim 2,8` does the same from
the command line. Interlaced H.264 (AVCHD 1080i) is deinterlaced. Masks, spot removal, lens corrections and crop don't apply to video.
See [docs/video.md](docs/video.md).


## Beyond the darkroom

| | |
|---|---|
| **Catalog** | Catalog v4: a redb store plus an operation log, several catalogs (New / Open Catalog), scheduled backups, integrity test, optimize; opens and migrates older library folders. |
| **Immich** | Connect one or more Immich (v3+) servers (API key in the system keychain); link existing photos, import from Immich, two-way metadata and album sync, XMP sidecars both ways, People and smart search, Immich as a publish service ([docs/immich.md](docs/immich.md)). |
| **Lightroom migration** | Imports a Lightroom Classic `.lrcat`: collections, smart collections, folder stacks, History and snapshots (as Versions). |
| **Network drives** | Catalogs and photos on mapped drives, `\\server\share` UNC paths and SMB/NFS mounts load and import on every OS. |
| **Tethering** | Studio capture (watched folder) and native PTP tethering over USB or Wi-Fi (PTP/IP). |
| **Plug-ins** | WebAssembly plug-ins in a `wasmi` sandbox: menu commands, export post-processing and destinations, custom metadata fields, metadata suggestions, publish services (Lightroom Lua plug-ins do not run). |
| **Output** | Publish services (Hard Drive, Immich, plug-ins), Edit In (copy with adjustments, TIFF / layered PSD), saved Actions, export presets, watermarks, HDR export, contact sheets. |
| **Print** | Printer ICC profile with rendering intent and black point compensation, Print Adjustment, 16-bit output; print to IPP/CUPS printers (`ipps://` with certificate trust; paper type, tray, quality and two-sided from the driver) or save PDF/JPEG. |
| **Updates** | A built-in updater checks this project's release feed, downloads and installs (off at start-up unless you turn it on). |

# Install


Release builds are listed on the project's releases page. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number,
`<binary>`/`<cli>` are the brand binary names, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file. Build them yourself
with `cargo xtask package`.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `<binary>-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `<binary>-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `<binary>-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `<binary>-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |

The installers and executables are not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may warn the first time you run them (More info ▸ Run anyway). The installer asks where to install (`C:\Program Files\<app>` by
default; upgrades stay in the folder you chose) and ends on a page confirming the app was installed, with an
option to start it. For unattended installs: `msiexec /i <binary>-<ver>-windows-x64.msi /qn INSTALLFOLDER="D:\Apps\<app>\"`.

**Update or uninstall asks for an old `.msi`, or stops with error 1612 or 1714?** Windows removes the installed version
with its own cached copy of that version's installer; if the copy is gone, it asks for the original file and stops
(an update then ends with error 1603). Download the release MSI of the version and build you have installed from the
releases page and run `msiexec /fv "<path to that .msi>" /qb+ /norestart`, approving the permission prompt if Windows
shows one. That restores the cached copy; then retry the update or uninstall. Opening the MSI, or choosing Repair or
Uninstall on it, may still fail. Error 1603 has other causes too; if this doesn't help, open an issue with the error
message.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `<binary>-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Not signed or notarized: macOS asks you to allow it on first open ([how](docs/manual/getting-started.md#install)) |
| Command-line tool, universal | `<cli>-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Not signed or notarized: macOS asks you to allow it on first open ([how](docs/manual/getting-started.md#install)) |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `<binary>-<ver>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | Runs anywhere; updates itself with [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) (`.zsync` files) |
| Flatpak | `<binary>-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `<binary>-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `<binary>-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `<binary>-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |

Linux ARM64 (aarch64) builds are paused; `packaging/linux/package.sh aarch64` still builds one locally.

### Android (early: see [docs/android.md](docs/android.md))

The Android app is the same app as the desktop one, with the same catalog, raw developer and edits, in a
**touch layout** made first for tablets and foldables (it works on phones too). Develop shows the photo alone; tap
it for a slim top bar and a tool strip, pick a tool (Basic, Colour, Tone, Detail, Optics, Effects) and drag on the
photo to set one slider at a time, then Done or Cancel; hold the photo to see the original. Swipe to scroll,
long-press to select several photos, and Back steps out one level at a time. Import photos, a folder or the camera
roll; export from the Export sheet to Pictures or share to another app.

The touch layout is on by default on Android and available on every platform: **Settings ▸ General ▸ Layout**
switches between Touch and Desktop (the choice is remembered).

The app collects nothing and works offline; see the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md) for the few features that go
online and what the Android permissions are for.

Install from the release's APKs:

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phones and tablets (arm64) | `<binary>-<ver>-android-arm64-v8a.apk` | Sideload: allow installs from your browser or file manager, then open the file |
| Emulator and Chromebooks (x86_64) | `<binary>-<ver>-android-x86_64.apk` | |
| Play Store bundle | `<binary>-<ver>-android-arm64-v8a-x86_64.aab` | For Play Console uploads, not for installing |

Android 9 or newer. Until a release signing key is set up, the APKs carry a test signature: they install, but a
build signed with the release key later will need the test build uninstalled first.

### Web (WebAssembly)

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static site | `<binary>-web-<ver>.zip` | Runs in a modern browser; host it on any static server |
