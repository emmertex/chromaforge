//! Give memory the system allocator keeps after frees back to the operating system.
//!
//! macOS's allocator keeps freed large blocks mapped as "reusable": they no longer count in the
//! process's memory footprint but stay in its resident size until the system runs short. After a
//! raw decode (hundreds of MB of temporaries) that made the resident size climb towards the sum of
//! everything ever decoded. `malloc_zone_pressure_relief` (libSystem) returns those pages now.
//!
//! glibc keeps them too: its mmap threshold rises with every large block freed (up to 32 MiB on
//! 64-bit), so decode buffers end up on the heap, and each worker thread's arena only shrinks from
//! its top. After a background preview build the resident size stayed near its peak.
//! `malloc_trim(0)` returns the free pages of every arena. Elsewhere (musl, Windows, FreeBSD)
//! nothing is called.
//!
//! [`fsync`] is the plain POSIX `fsync`, which std doesn't offer on macOS: there `File::sync_all`
//! and `sync_data` are `F_FULLFSYNC`, which SMB shares refuse with ENOTSUP while `fsync` works
//! (upstream issue 1407).
//!
//! [`lower_thread_priority`] runs the calling thread below normal priority (Windows'
//! `SetThreadPriority`), so renders leave the desktop responsive.
//!
//! [`free_disk_space`] says how much room a drive has (Windows' `GetDiskFreeSpaceExW`; elsewhere
//! POSIX `df`, no system call of our own), for the preview cache's automatic size.
//!
//! This is one of the workspace's few crates allowed `unsafe` (two FFI calls in `macos`, one in
//! `glibc`, three in `windows`). Its API is safe; on failure or on other platforms each call simply does nothing.
//!
//! It also says how much memory the process may use ([`limits`], safe std-only code): physical RAM
//! held to the process's cgroup limit on Linux, for the engine's memory budget and `cargo xtask ci`.
