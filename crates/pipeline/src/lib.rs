//! The develop pipeline (CPU reference implementation).
//!
//! Input: a scene-referred, linear Rec.2020 source image (already EXIF-oriented) at any resolution
//! (full size or a proxy), plus [`DevelopSettings`]. Output: a display-encoded sRGB image at the
//! requested size, and its histogram.
//!
//! Stage order (see `docs/pipeline.md`):
//! 1. geometry — user orientation, lens corrections (distortion, CA, vignetting), perspective, crop +
//!    straighten, flips; one resample at output resolution; then defringe
//! 2. scene-linear — white balance, spot removal, noise reduction, Smooth Skin ([`skin`]), then
//!    exposure, dehaze, local tone (highlights/shadows), texture, clarity, local adjustments (masks)
//! 3. tone map — contrast / whites / blacks filmic curve on luminance, highlight desaturation
//! 4. colour — vibrance, saturation, colour mixer, colour grading, B&W (OkLCh)
//! 5. display — gamut map to the output space (sRGB unless [`RenderRequest::space`] says otherwise), encode, tone curves (parametric + point), vignette, grain
//!
//! Spatial parameters are specified relative to the image's long edge, so a 400 px preview and a
//! 60 MP export look alike.
//!
//! Exposure is a gain, so the spatial stages run on the un-exposed image and the per-pixel stage
//! applies it (filters on log luminance are shift-equivariant: identical result). With
//! [`render_cached`] each stage's output is reused while its inputs are unchanged ([`StageCache`]):
//! dragging a tone, colour or exposure slider re-runs only the per-pixel stage.
