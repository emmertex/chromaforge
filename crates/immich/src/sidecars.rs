//! IMM-SIDECARS: XMP sidecars as Immich stores them (plan/immich.md → Sidecars).
//!
//! Immich keeps an `.xmp` sidecar next to every uploaded asset (its library copy) and, for an
//! external library, beside the original on disk. Its public API (v3.2.0) lists an asset's files
//! (`GET /asset-files?assetId=…&type=sidecar`) and serves one (`GET /asset-files/{id}/download`),
//! so the app can read back the XMP it sent with an upload — including its own `lc:settings`
//! develop settings — and apply it to another catalog photo. That is what makes an Immich server
//! a bridge between two libraries: one instance publishes originals with their sidecars, another
//! imports or links the assets and pulls the sidecars back.
//!
//! Writing a *managed* asset's sidecar is not exposed by the API: a sidecar travels only with an
//! upload, and afterwards Immich merges the fields it supports (description, rating, capture time,
//! location, tags) into the sidecar when they are updated. For an external library the sidecar is
//! the file on disk, which the app writes itself. [`crate::publish`] sends a photo's whole XMP with
//! its original.
//!
//! Sources: own design; Immich's public API documentation and its XMP sidecar documentation
//! (plan/immich.md → Sidecars).
