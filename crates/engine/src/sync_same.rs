//! Auto Sync carries the active photo's VALUE to every selected photo. Where white balance is a
//! mode rather than a number, the mode travels and each photo applies it to itself: As Shot gives
//! each photo its own camera white, Auto each photo's own white from its pixels, a light preset
//! its numbers.
//!
//! A typed or dragged Temp or Tint is set on each photo's own scale: a raw edited in Kelvin gets
//! the same Kelvin (an old relative-scale value converted first, never read as Kelvin), and only
//! the slider that moved changes (a Temp move keeps each photo's own tint). A photo on another
//! scale than the active one (a JPEG next to a raw) has no "same" number and moves by as much as
//! the active photo instead.
