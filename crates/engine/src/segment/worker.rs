//! The SAM 3 worker thread: it owns the model and the last encoded photo, and runs every
//! request (load, render the model input, encode, clicks, descriptions, detail passes) in
//! turn. The session only sends jobs and receives outcomes over channels, so no thread ever
//! waits on a lock the model holds, and the UI thread never runs the model.
//!
//! Every job runs under `catch_unwind`: a panic inside candle becomes an error outcome, drops
//! the (possibly inconsistent) model and leaves the worker ready for the next job. The busy
//! counters are decremented by drop guards, so they can't stay stuck. The model is unloaded
//! after [`IDLE_UNLOAD`] without requests (it holds several GB).
//!
//! Where the model can run on the GPU (Metal on macOS), a job that fails there (a panic or an
//! error from candle, e.g. a kernel the GPU's compiler can't build, issue #1974) frees the
//! model and runs once more on the CPU. When that works, the model stays on the CPU for the rest
//! of the session and the job's outcome says so; when it fails too, the GPU wasn't the cause and
//! the next job uses it again. `<PREFIX>_GPU=0` or `<PREFIX>_GPU_BACKEND=off` keep the model on
//! the CPU from the start.
