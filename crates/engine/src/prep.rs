//! Preparing photos in the background: while the user culls, the photos ahead are made ready
//! before they are reached, and with the machine otherwise idle the previews of every photo in
//! view are built, so stepping never waits for a render.
//!
//! What is prepared is set per mode, because each mode needs something else:
//! - **Culling** (a folder browsed before import): previews of every photo in the folder, the next
//!   photos' loupe renders and their eye focus strips.
//! - **Library**: the same for the photos in the library's view.
//! - **Develop** (editing): the next photos decoded and kept ready to edit.
//!
//! Each mode has its own switch for the whole-view build, how many photos ahead to prepare (0 =
//! none) and which photos ([`Scope`]). The settings are app-wide (the app store's `shared.json`)
//! and a library can keep its own (its `prefs.json`): a timelapse library prepares nothing while a
//! wedding library prepares everything.
//!
//! The whole-view build is the preview build ([`crate::cmd::previews`]) in its background form: two
//! lanes, waiting whenever the photo on screen is being made ([`foreground`]) and while the user's
//! own work runs (an export, an import: [`crate::activity::Activity::user_work`]), nearest photos to
//! the user first and re-aimed as they move ([`crate::cmd::previews::PreviewBuild::focus_on`]),
//! photos with previews skipped, one row in the activity stack that can be cancelled. It starts
//! once the user is culling (a few photos stepped through in the loupe), never just because a
//! library was opened (opening an old library to look at two photos must not start rebuilding).
//!
//! The pictures on screen come first: while a grid or filmstrip cell, or the loupe, still lacks
//! its first picture (not even the cheapest, a raw's embedded JPEG or a cached thumbnail), the
//! frontend says so every frame ([`pictures_missing`]) and background work that reads raws waits
//! ([`wait_for_pictures`]): eye finding, culling scans, this preparation. The signals hold for a
//! moment after the last call, so a frontend that stops saying it (the pictures arrived, or it
//! closed) never holds anything back for long.
//!
//! Sources: own design (OneSlips: PERF-CULL-TIERS, "lowest and fastest resolution first, then the
//! next cheap one, then anything bigger"; PERF-PREVIEW-PREP, A1-PREP-RESYNC, PREP-NEIGHBOURS).
