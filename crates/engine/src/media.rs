//! Source proxies and render jobs.
//!
//! Sources are decoded (or generated) once per level and cached in memory LRUs: `Thumb` (≤ 512 px
//! long edge) for the grid and filmstrip, `Preview` (≤ 2560 px) for the loupe, `Full` (native
//! resolution, the last one only) for exports larger than a preview. A [`RenderJob`] is
//! self-contained and `Send`: frontends run it on a worker thread; if the source wasn't cached yet
//! the job loads it and hands it back in the [`RenderResult`] so the cache can keep it.
//!
//! Rendered thumbnails are cached too ([`lcc_preview::PreviewCache`]: memory LRU, plus a
//! disk cache in the library's `thumbs/` folder), keyed by the photo's content hash, the develop
//! settings hash, the size and [`RENDER_CACHE_VERSION`] — so reopening a library shows its grid
//! without decoding a single original, and an edit simply produces a new key.
//!
//! Opening a photo shows something at once ([`QuickJob`]): the loupe's last render for the current
//! settings (kept in the same cache under a size-independent "view" key), else the camera's
//! embedded JPEG for an unedited raw, else a thumbnail-level render — while the real render is
//! prepared. Grid thumbnails of unedited raws likewise start from the embedded preview.
