//! Copy first, then upgrade: before a library's catalog is rewritten in a newer format (the v3 →
//! v4 migration, or a v4 store marked with this build's format version), the files an older
//! build reads are copied to `backups/before-v<N> <time>/` and checked byte for byte. Only then
//! is the library itself upgraded, so the version that made it can still open the copy, and the
//! user can go back by opening that folder with it (or copying its files back).
//!
//! The copy is made in a hidden `.before-v<N> <time>.partial` folder that is renamed into place
//! only once every file is copied, synced and verified. A failure on the way (a full disk, an
//! unwritable folder, a source that changed while it was read) removes the partial folder and
//! returns an error that says the library was left unchanged and what to do; a crash leaves only
//! the partial folder, which the next upgrade removes. Nothing in the library is written before
//! the copy is complete.
//!
//! Sources: own design (after OneSlips' "upgraded copy" of an older library).
