//! A time limit on creating a GPU device (issue #3068).
//!
//! Creating the wgpu instance, adapter and device, and compiling the kernels after it, are calls
//! into the graphics driver, and on Linux the driver may talk to the display server first. With an
//! unresponsive one (a crash-looping WSLg compositor, a socket that accepts and never answers)
//! those calls never return, and wgpu's native calls are synchronous (`pollster::block_on` gets an
//! already-finished future), so there is nothing to time out from the calling thread.
//!
//! So every device (rendering, denoise, faces) is made by [`create`] on a thread of its own, and
//! the caller waits until [`limit`] (`<PREFIX>_GPU_INIT_TIMEOUT`) passes with no [`Progress`]: each
//! kernel built counts, so a first start that compiles every kernel slowly (an empty driver shader
//! cache after an install or a driver update: 30 s on an RTX 4070 SUPER and an RTX 5070 under DX12)
//! still ends on the GPU, while a driver call that never returns is given up on after the limit as
//! before (and any creation after [`limit`] times [`PROGRESS_CAP`] in all). Past it the caller gets an
//! `Err` that it caches like any other creation failure — the GPU is unavailable for the process —
//! and the blocked thread is left behind. That thread keeps what has to last as long as the driver
//! work does: its share of the GPU work in flight (`exit.rs`: a quit then reports the GPU busy
//! instead of tearing the driver down under it) and the crash sentinel (`backend.rs`: a quit
//! leaves the marker, so the next launch starts on the CPU). While one is left behind, later creations (another kind
//! of device) fail at once with the same reason instead of leaving another thread behind; should
//! the driver come back, the late device is leaked (never dropped into a driver that just hung)
//! and creations are tried again.
//!
//! The error scopes popped after creation (`scope.pop()`) need no limit: on native wgpu they
//! resolve at once, and they are thread-local, so they could not move to another thread anyway.
