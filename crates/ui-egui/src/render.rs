//! Background rendering: engine [`RenderJob`]s run on a [`JobPool`]; results become textures.
//!
//! Each visible thing that needs pixels is a *slot* (a grid thumbnail, the loupe, the "before"
//! image…). Requests are deduplicated per slot (a newer request replaces a queued older one) and
//! prioritised (loupe first, then on-screen thumbnails, then prefetch); thumbnails scrolled far
//! out of view are dropped from the queue. Thumbnail jobs hit the engine's preview cache (memory +
//! disk) before rendering. On wasm the jobs run inline, one per frame, unless the host installs a
//! [`RenderOffload`] (the browser build's Web Workers): then queued jobs are handed to it as it has
//! room, and its results are collected every frame.
//!
//! Stand-ins ([`QuickJob`]s, once per photo and settings): [`Slot::Preview`] holds what the loupe
//! shows until [`Slot::Main`] has the photo's render (cached view render, embedded camera JPEG or
//! a thumbnail render); [`Slot::ThumbQuick`] holds a raw's embedded preview in the grid until its
//! rendered thumbnail arrives (a cached thumbnail found by the quick job becomes the
//! [`Slot::Thumb`] texture directly).
