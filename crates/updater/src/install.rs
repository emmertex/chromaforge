//! Installing what was downloaded.
//!
//! Every platform ends the same way: the new build is running, or the user is told in one sentence
//! what to do next. Nothing here panics, and nothing touches the current installation until the
//! replacement file is complete and checked ([`crate::download`]).
//!
//! | Platform | Artifact | What happens |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Windows | `.msi` | the installer runs (`msiexec`), then the app starts again |
//! | macOS | `.dmg` | mounted, its app copied beside the running bundle, checked and swapped in, relaunched |
//! | Linux | `.AppImage` | once the app has quit, the running file is replaced and the new one started |
//! | Windows, a copy unpacked from the portable zip | `.zip` | unpacked beside the program, its files swapped in, the new version started once the app has quit, undone if it can't start ([`zipswap`]) |
//! | anywhere else | `.tar.gz` / `.zip` | the folder it is in is shown, to unpack it yourself |
//!
//! The caller quits the app when [`Outcome::exit`] is `true` — the installer or the replacement
//! script needs the running program out of the way — and shows [`Outcome::message`] either way.
